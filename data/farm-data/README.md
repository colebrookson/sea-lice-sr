### *canadian-gov-open-data*

### *farm-sea-lice-database-peaccock* 

These data were supplied from Stephanie Peacock to Cole on Friday April 22, 2022 to support efforts to double check the proportion of *L. salmonis* vs. *C. clemensi* in the year 2001, since the only data that were collected were of chalimus staged lice (not identifiable to species). These data are not used subsequently.
