Cole,

 

I have updated the reconstructions through 2021 for the Odd and Even years Inner South Coast Pink Stocks (Attached is the data set by CU, I have not updated the document at this time but hope to in the future).  There is a significant amount of infilling in escapements within CUs and between CUs to deal with unmonitored stocks and CUs.  The method was detailed in the original documentations and has not changed since.  Enhanced Pink are also not removed out of this data set so take the R/S information with a grain of salt for CUs with significant enhanced contributions.

 

The Chum work will still be awhile.

 

Thanks
