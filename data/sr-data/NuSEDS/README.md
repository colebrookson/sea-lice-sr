# NuSEDS Documentation

All data in this folder are sourced directly from the Canadian government dataset: NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System which can be found [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6). 

For this analysis, NuSEDS was downloaded multiple times to ensure as up-to-date data as possible. **The most recent download was on JUNE 02 2022 at 13:33EST.**

Data cleaning processes for these data were as automated as possible, but sometimes included some manual actions.
