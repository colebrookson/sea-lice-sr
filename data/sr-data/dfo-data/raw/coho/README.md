# Notes on Coho Data Collection & Methods






# Info From DFO Collaborators

## Original Data Request (email from Emma to collaborators)

Coho: I realise that coho are quite data-limited, and generating S-R estimates gets pretty hand-wavy pretty quickly. With that being said, do you have exploitation rate estimates (encompassing commercial and recreational catch) that you feel would be reasonable to use to generate recruitment estimates for Area 12 coho populations? I know you mentioned that the methods have changed from using Keogh and Black as indicators. I'll defer to you with respect to whether it is worth trying to generate S-R estimates for coho, and how best to go about it...

Hello Emma.  I’ll try to respond on the coho S/R issues.

 

We have quite a bit of exploitation data for the hatchery indicators (Quinsam, Big Qualicum, Robertson) but that doesn’t work for wild coho which are not adipose clipped.  As I’m sure you’re aware, there is a mark selective fishery for coho so that all (or most) hatchery coho are clipped, so getting exploitation data on wild coho is problematic (wild coho are unclipped, otherwise this stock would be treated as a hatchery stock, thus altering it’s usefulness as a wild coho indicator).  For the wild indicator at Black Creek, we developed a model that compares the commercial fishery effort during a baseline period (1985-1994, I think) to effort during the current period, and uses that comparison to alter the observed exploitation rate in the baseline to produce an ER estimate for recent years.  It’s not a great model, there’s very little variability between years, and commercial and sport openings have changed over the last 25+ years.  It’s all we have at the moment.  Most of this ER is bycatch in other fisheries.  We do incorporate the reported catches in the Northern Troll fishery because every coho is scanned for a CWT, including the unclipped ones so Black Creek coho show up.

 

Keogh coho hasn’t been included in the annual Exploitation rate and Marine survival estimate process because it was outside the area covered by the Canada/US Salmon Treaty Coho sections.

 

Pieter, correct me if I’m wrong, but wild Keogh coho are clipped as well as cwt’d?  If so, this was continued because the distribution of this stock was not into mark-selective fishery regulation areas.  As such we should be able to get an exploitation rate, but it isn’t representative of stocks further south.

 

I’ve attached a file that shows the exploitation rate and marine survival estimates for the southern BC indicators, but doesn’t include Keogh.

Hi Steve, 

Thanks for the info and the exploitation data, that's very helpful. I'll take a deeper look at the data when I'm at my computer. When you say Keogh ERs wouldn't be representative of southern stocks, do you mean south island stocks or even other coho stocks in Area 12? 

Right now, we're trying to gauge whether there is a relatively appropriate proxy system with reasonable ER estimates to extrapolate to populations within but not beyond Area 12. For charming but cryptic coho, we're starting with so much uncertainty even in the escapement estimates that we're not looking for perfection but rather an indicator system whose exploitation dynamics are likely to be relatively reflective of the Broughton/mainland inlet systems. Perhaps that is an impossible mission! Let me know if you have further thoughts on the matter. Or give me a call if that's easier: 604-379-1865.

I'm also going to loop our other colleagues (Steph, Andrew, and Sean) into this thread in case they have other comments/Q's in mind. 

Thanks again, Steve and Pieter, for the helpful info amidst a busy time of year.

### Steve - March 21, 2022

You’re safe for other stocks in Area 12 and likely Central Coast.  I was referring to stocks in the lower Strait of Georgia, so Quinsam/Campbell and south.  Keogh is your best candidate for that area, and has the most high quality data.

### Matt Clarke - March 21, 2022

On the Keogh, we do clip and tag a portion of the wild run (apx 50% or target ~ 50k). 

 

We have complete counts of juveniles from there since 1977, and accurate adult counts (resistivity counter) since 1998.  Less accurate counts on adults are available prior to 1998.    The CWT/ad clip bit gives us exploitation throughout the marine phase.  We also have decent age-composition data relative to other systems on the North Island.    

 

Keogh Coho seem to exhibit a far north migration strategy, although we also see some off the WCVI, and south through Washington and Oregon.  They definitely don’t seem to hang around.  We don’t see a lot of tag recoveries in the MSF areas, and have seen very few in the SOG.

 

Let me know what is needed and I’ll try to pass that along.    

### Emma - March 28, 2022 -- To Cole, Sean, Steph, Andrew

I think I'll follow up with Matt and Steve to request the data from the Keogh and any exploitation data they have available from the indicators that Brendan used in his previous compilation. I agree it's smart not to prematurely close doors for lack of data that we could have requested.

### Emma - March 28, 2022 -- To All

Thanks for the additional context, Matt and Steve. Much appreciated. If possible, we would like to request the exploitation rate estimates and age-at-return distributions for Keogh coho, as up-to-date as is available and dating as far back as possible.

I see that the spreadsheet you shared, Steve, includes ER estimates for Big Qualicum, Quinsam, and Black Creek. That's great. The last (only?) stock-recruit compilation I am familiar with for Area 12 coho populations used those three systems as ER indicators (see attached). Based on your comments, it sounds like it might be prudent for us to consider using the Keogh instead, but it would be interesting to compare to see whether/how the estimates differ. Let me know if you have any comments on that front - I imagine you are both more intimately familiar with the data than I am. Again, feel free to call if easier. 

Pieter - let me know when/if you have an update on the pink/chum data. See my previous question re: how reasonable it would be to use the old chum run reconstruction or a preliminary version of the new one. 

Thanks all! Really appreciate your insights.

Just a note that the SR coho data in Krkosek et al, (2011) go to 2009 I think, while Connors et al, (2010) only go to 2007. But maybe they indexed the years differently? I didn’t look into it in detail. I think they use the same approach to estimating ER though, as you stated.

### Emma -- March 28, 2022 -- To Small Group 

Oh, great point. I forgot that Marty included coho in his analysis. He cites Brendan's paper in the SI and the data I have from Brendan that we used for the SCFS salmon report go through 2009. So my hunch would be that he just used the same data... But I could be wrong about that.

### Steve - March 31, 2022

Hello Emma.  You’ll have to rely on Pieter’s shop for the Keogh Coho ER and age-at-return although virtually all coho are age 1.0 (jacks) or 1.1 (adults).  2 year old smolts (age 2.0 and 2.1) are known, but pretty rare this far south.

That data hasn’t been worked up as part of the southern BC Coho Forecast process so I’m not familiar with what is available.  

### Emma - March 31, 2022

Thanks, Steve. 

That's actually quite useful/interesting, because I think many of the published S-R analyses I am familiar with (e.g., Connors et al. 2010) assume a fixed 3-year life cycle.

I'll wait to hear from Pieter on the data side of things.

### Steve - March 31, 2022

Emma, just to be clear the age format I used is one that is commonly used (but not universal) for coho.  1.1 indicates one winter in freshwater, 1 winter in marine water.  This is equivalent to a three year old life history.  Steve

### Emma - March 31, 2022

Ah, I wondered if I was missing something. Roger that. ;-)

### Matt - March 31, 2022 

Sorry All,

 

I’ve been having email issues, but believe I have them sorted out. 

 

Emma, are you good if I send you the CWT, age, and escapement data directly?  That will give you the most flexibility in your analysis.
