# Important Data Cleaning Considerations

## Farm Data 

NOTE: Glacier has two sites (9 & 10) in Gary Marty map. 

### Current Questions:

1) Gary Marty data has data in 2000-2002 that includes measurements of fish >600 days at sea with no counts and counts right after treatments. Should both of those be included? Keeping them in for now but want clarification. 

2) There seem to be some farms that don't stay consistent through time (show two maps) - you can see the ones here that Gary Marty has data for, and the ones that we have data for from the public database. Is it ok to just include all the farms we have data for at any given point? (e.g. in years where Wa-kwa is present, we use the data from that farm, and the same for the farms we only have Marty data for)



**Dates:** The data as they come, have a number of actual dates (including day) but those only extend back to 2020. Previous to that, we only have month and year data. It's possible to come up with a day (to have a full date) but that would be fully a guess. *Is this worth it?*

## Relating Lice Data

So the farm data have total and average counts separated out for both leps and cals, but the SCFS data are more comprehensive, and include more columns. For now I'm just summing all values that relate to either species and then an additional column that sums every single type of louse measurement. 

## Wild Lice Data

* Note that weeks 28, 33, and 9 were removed as they had too few observations (3, 9, and 18) respectively.
