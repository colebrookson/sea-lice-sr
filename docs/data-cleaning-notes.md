## Farm Data 

**Dates:** The data as they come, have a number of actual dates (including day) but those only extend back to 2020. Previous to that, we only have month and year data. It's possible to come up with a day (to have a full date) but that would be fully a guess. *Is this worth it?*

## Relating Lice Data

So the farm data have total and average counts separated out for both leps and cals, but the SCFS data are more comprehensive, and include more columns. For now I'm just summing all values that relate to either species and then an additional column that sums every single type of louse measurement.
