## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 1)

### Storing and archiving version-controlled data
*contributors to this section:* 
Another potential use case/user perspective: Some people are just using GitHub to  backup their data, use their code on differnt machines. Just push and pull (Box 1) from their own repo. 
GitHub integrates with Zenodo, a popular, free data archiving service funded by CERN. After linking your GitHub account to Zenodo and turning on archiving, any time a release (Box 1) is made, a snapshot of the entire repository is archived in Zenodo with a versioned, citable DOI

### Virtual lab notebook
*contributors to this section:*
commits as a way to record daily progress
issues as a way to keep track of short-term objectives/goals, and progress towards them

### Responding to reviewer comments
*contributors to this section:*
using github issues (Box 1) to organize and respond to reviewer comments on a manuscript. See example [here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22reviewer+comment%22+)

### Classroom teaching / educational materials
*contributors to this section: Cole Brookson*

GitHub provides a large variety of uses for hosting teaching/educational materials. In fact, through taking advantage of the suite of GitHub features, the entire process of running a course, workshop, or even just a lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub. As a matter of gross simplification, organizing a course (for example) could be broken down into: 1) developing the material (i.e. slides, examples, relevant readings, labs, etc.), 2) hosting the course on some online platform for students to access, 3) delivering the content, and 4) dealing with student submissions and the subsequent grade returns. While of course there are other purpose-built platforms for this type of activity, few of them provide the usability at the price point GitHub does. First, developing your course material, from slides to labs and everything in between, can be done on GitHub, out in the open, where others can see, review and offer feedback on your process! Making presentations can be done through most major high-level programming languages such as [R, with `RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html), [Python, with `python-ppt`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and [Julia, with `Remark.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/remark). Since all these programs work via code bases, they can be version-controlled through git and GitHub. Once you've made all the content for your course, hosting a course website can be done through GitHub pages, and there are [lots of templates available](https://github.com/topics/course-website) to borrow from. This way, not only can the course content be available to your enrolled students, but also to anyone interested in the course material. Since the course material can be easily housed on a GitHub pages website, it is then simple enough to deliver the content via that website, and/or a GitHub organization with template repositories for assignments etc. Student submissions are perhaps the least seamless component, but for assignments submitted as code files (i.e. `.R` & `.Rmd` as two of the most common) and/or `.pdf` files, GitHub has a new and far-from-perfect but still useful tool [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) where instructors can host private assignments, and even build custom autograding tests, that will autograde assignments!
 
The previous section is meant to highlight the myriad tools GitHub can provide to centralize the delivery of educational materials. While most instructors will likely choose to pick from this selection and end up having a mix of tools to deliver their content to students, it is still valuable to utilize some of these, if only for the reason that it can encourage students to even *begin* learning about version control through interacting with git/GitHub, however minimally, through the course. There are (as always) no "points" awarded for using ALL GitHub materials ALL the time, but if a central tenant of a given course or educational unit is to introduce or give students experience to version control and the tools that working professionals in the biological sciences use, then adopting a few of these tools can be a great way to do so.
