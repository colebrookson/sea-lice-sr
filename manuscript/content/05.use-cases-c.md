'thus preserving the long-term integrity of the project even as collaborations form and shift.â€™ (Hampton et al. 2015) 
better to have old versions on GitHub than on somebody's personal hard drive!

### GitHub organizations
*Contributors to this section: Cole Brookson*
Lab organization as a place to house research compendia as well as codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, etc. (documents that evolve over time and are shaped collaboratively)
Students can have full ownership over repositories in organization, but stay with the lab after they've left.

Utilizing GitHub organizations as a research group or even for a handful of individuals working on a group of projects can be incredibly useful for all involved. GitHub organizations are relatively easy to set up, and especially easy to manage as membership to the organization changes through time. Not only is it a useful way to store repositories of lab-related research products, but it's also incredibly helpful for storing "living documents" that may be edited frequently, and may be linked to a lab website (that could also be generated via a repository that lives within the organization!). The use of the "Teams" feature can allow certain groups to have varying levels of access to repos in the organization with a select group having push access to some repos but not others. This can manifest in a group working on some common dataset(s) (e.g. some genetic data) to have push access to the handful of repositories used for processing sequence data, while another group of students/researchers may have push access to an entirely different set of repos. The organization structure also allows for easy tracking of issues, projects, and discussions related to the research group, and provides PIs/group leads an easy birds-eye view of the progress going on across multiple projects.

As well, organizations provide a convenient location for students to archive the code for their projects, for use/reference by future students in the research group, thus providing a type of knowledge communication that may not exist otherwise. Indeed, providing new students with access to the organization and ideally a template repository for lab projects can soften the burden on those new to the software, in that it provides them with examples to work off of, and an online location to ask for help from their labmates and/or advisors through tools like projects, discussions, and issues.

Developing data standards - This is pretty specific case from our team at Berkeley Lab, so I can write about it in a sentence or two here.
Code review rOpenSci's code review process, and also caught mistakes in code of published papers that could have been caught in peer code review.  Also maybe say something about ReproHack.
